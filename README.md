# Naive Bayes Classification - Predictive Modeling

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Naive Bayes Classifier** to solve a classification problem based on Bayes' Theorem. Naive Bayes is known for its efficiency and effectiveness in high-dimensional datasets. The goal was to build a robust baseline model and analyze its performance using probabilistic distributions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Algorithm:** Gaussian Naive Bayes
* **Key Techniques:** Data Preprocessing, Probability Distribution Analysis, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).



## 🚀 Key Highlights
* **Probabilistic Approach:** Leveraged the assumption of conditional independence between features to build a highly scalable model.
* **Gaussian Distribution:** Analyzed feature distributions to ensure compatibility with the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm.
* **Model Evaluation:** Detailed performance tracking using a Confusion Matrix to minimize false positives and false negatives.



## 📊 Results & Business Impact
